## Cover letter
Passion is the biggest influencing factor when I made the decision to choose this job. <br>

People's need for entertainment and gaming is increasingly high. That means that game production companies must have products with a high level of perfection, bringing the most satisfaction to players, especially when technology has new breakthroughs. I think I am suitable for the position of QA game tester with the skills of detailed observation, analysis, and finding bug and sugget solution. It's not that just by playing the game you'll find bug. For regular players, sometimes they won't realize it's bug. With Game Tester, it is different, QA needs to quickly recognize what is bug and what is a feature. Another skill is that the game tester must be able to reproduce the detected bug. The purpose is to explain to the programming department and come up with a solution. Besides, there are teamwork, communication and quick learning skills to improve professional skills. <br>

Seeking a position as a Tester where I can utilize my testing skills, abilities, and experiences gained through relevant education and projects to contribute to the ongoing success of the company. ✌️ <br>
